	<h1>Welcome To Camp</h1>
	<h2>Your first Lesson Will Be On Basic Tags</h2>
	<h3>Setup</h3>
	<p>Every web page starts the same so this code can be done by simply typing 'html' followed by tab, this is used to set up the document </p>
	<h3>Tags</h3>
	<p>Tags are how you write text in html - this is the basics of all websites. A tag's basic job is to tell the internet browser how the text should be shown. A tag consits of 2 part an intial &lt;h1&gt; with text in the middle followed by &lt;/h1&gt; eg &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt; would diplay <h1>Hello World</h1></p>
	<h3>&lt;title&gt;</h3>
	<p>Inbetween the tags is the title of your website, this is the only thing that should be modified within the head tags at this time</p>
	<h3>&lt;body&gt;</h3>
	<p>Neraly everything you write in html will be between the body tags</p>
	<h3>The First Tag You Will Write Is The Header Tag, &lt;h1&gt;</h3>
	<p>This tag makes the text inside a header. Using different numbers after the h will result in smaller text but still larger then the main text.</p>
	<h3>The Next Tag Is The Paragraph Tag, &lt;p&gt;</h3>
	<p>This tag is used for the main body of the page.</p>
	<h3>Task</h3>
	<p>Everything on this page can be written with just the tags provided, so now your job is to make a quick 'Profile page' this should use the header tags to specfiy the field names e.g. 'First Name:', 'Age:' and the p tags to answer these questions.</p>
