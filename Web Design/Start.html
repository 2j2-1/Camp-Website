	<h1>Welcome To Camp</h1>
	<p>This class will be on basic web design, it will start off very simple but quickly pick up to making a full website. If you have previous experinece skip though the web pages at your own speed and if you come to the end of the of web pages you should know enough to make your own website </p>
	<p>If you would rather just skip the learning and make a web site then simply <a href="profile.html">click here!</a> to view the template which you can then modifiy</p>
	<p>At any time you can open up the html file to look at the example that should guide you as I will only be using elements in the web page to build that page. If you get stuck google is your best friend, google as much as possible, the better at using google you are the easier your life will be. Finally, if you're still stuck ask me, I won't bite and will be happy to help with any problems you may be having.</p>
