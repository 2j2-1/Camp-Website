	<h2>Extra Tags</h2>
	<p>A few extra tags are used while making a website:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&lt;a&gt; this tag is used to link to other web pages and sections in the document</li>
		<li>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; these are used to created a list of bullet points</li>
		<li>&lt;div&gt; is a speacial one becuase it doesnt actually do anything so people dont normally use it as a begnnier but as the web site increases in size it because easier to manage sections within divs, these can also be used later to style portions of the page</li>
	</ul>
